# Credit-Card-Default-Prediction
using Machine Learning to predict whether a person is likely to default on their credit card repayment based on the information collected about the individual

## Overview
This project is dedicated to predicting credit card defaults using a variety of machine learning models. Through meticulous feature engineering and model testing, we aim to provide a reliable tool to assess credit risks.

## 🌟 Highlights
- 📈 Achieved an accuracy of 81% using feature engineering and testing machine learning models.
- 🤖 Evaluated models including Logistic Regression, SVM, Neural Networks, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest for credit card default prediction.
- 📊 Leveraged R for comprehensive data preparation, manipulation, visualization, and analysis.
